It doesn't matter if everything's good or not if you feel alone -- you feel alone there's no way around it.Even when you're surrounded with friends and you're having the best time of your life the other day.  
You still feel shitty the next day and it happens.  
  
Sometimes you'll get these weird thoughts and you start to question everything in your life. You never believe that mental illness is actually a thing until you face it yourself.  
_You begin to think if anything really matters  
what are these efforts are really for  
what are we living for exactly  
what difference will it make after 3 months if we kill ourselves right now

It's so confusing naa.Sometimes I think what am I doing wrong..  
They said being fit and working out makes you feel good -- checked  
They said making friends and having good time with them makes you feel good -- checked  
They said listening to music makes you feel good -- checked  
They said having passion for one thing working towards that makes you feel good -- checked  
Why am I feeling this way then...Well no answer to that question..  
I now see why people turn to smoking and drinking. They are just trying to get out of it .. get out of this shitty hole of constant loneliness.

And during these hard times there's nothing more you can do if you're anything like me try spitting whatever is on your mind and put _[kun faya kun](https://youtu.be/T94PHkuydcw?t=159)_ on repeat (I skipped to the best part in the link). It really helps.Try to avoid instagram or any porn related activities its not worth it.
