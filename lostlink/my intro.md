My name is Rajesh Behera, and I am currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in Electronics and Telecommunication at KIIT University. Alongside my primary degree, I have also chosen to specialize in Computer Science as a minor. With a strong passion for web development, I have dedicated the past four years to honing my skills in this field.

I have my foundation all cleared up with HTML,CSS & Javascript.
I have gained a thorough knowledge  in the widely recognized React framework and I am currently expanding my expertise by acquainting myself with Next.js, a powerful full-stack framework.
On the back-end, I have acquired experience working with Node.js and Express, enabling me to build robust and scalable server-side components. To ensure efficient data storage, I am well-versed in MongoDB and utilize Mongoose as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) tool.

 I have recently developed a keen interest in Linux, drawn to its versatile environment and the freedom it offers to users. I have accepted the core idea of linux of dividing big complex problems into smaller parts and tackle them individually.
