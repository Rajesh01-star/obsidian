Some anime(s) are good some are shit...
but those anime(s) that I am listing below you can have my word for it, are the best of all

- ## Dragon ball 
	how can you say good anime and not take the name of this masterpiece which started all of it.
	It's the best shonen anime there is (no question asked) and may be the fighting sequences is bit too stretched out but hey at-least Goku's goal was not 
	****to fondle some boobs****
	
		In simple words "how a small alien kid become the most powerful mortal of not only our universe but in all reality"

- ## Berserk
	If you consider yourself in anyway soft please don't watch this anime (no kidding).
	It's just out of expectations and you won't be able to see what's going to happen.
	A must watch for "**Gothic**" anime fans.
	
		"A solo mercenary warrior groups with a band and starts to achieve unbelievable feats but soon he had to bear the extreme flames of hell, being on the surface itself .

- ## Devilman Crybaby
	again a more adult class anime and includes a lot of brutal scenes that aren't for soft hearted people.
	If you're considering to watch this then do not expect regular style animation, it's going to be absolutely out of the world.

		 "**a depiction of how humans can be as violent and cruel as the so-called demons**." 
this is taken from the web I have no words to explain what I saw.

- ## Tokyo Ghoul
	It's one of the first anime that I watched as a result of which I came across an opening that hits so hard you'll have no conscious of what's reality and what's not (am talking about the opening)
	as of the anime it started really well but slowly it lost it's edge.
	it's in the list purely because of it's opening.

- ## jobless reincarnation anime
	it's my 2nd favorite anime.
	Just take my words and watch it once you'll not regret spending time to watch it.
	it got everything "magic", "adventure" , "action", "..." (... sums up all the aspect of entertainment)

		"A man you got a second chance and how he learns in that second life the mistakes he made in his first..."
